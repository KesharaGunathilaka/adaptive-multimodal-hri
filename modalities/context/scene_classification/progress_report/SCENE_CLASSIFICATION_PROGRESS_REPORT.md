## 2. HYPERPARAMETER TUNING ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Tuning Strategy

Grid search was performed over:
- **Learning Rates**: [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001, 0.00005]
- **Batch Sizes**: [16, 32, 64]
- **Optimizers**: [Adam, SGD]
- **Total Combinations**: 24

### 2.2 Rationale for Hyperparameter Choices

#### Learning Rate Selection
- **0.001** (Too high): May cause training instability
- **0.0005** (Medium): Balance between convergence and stability
- **0.0001** (Recommended)**: Conservative fine-tuning of pretrained weights
- **0.00005** (Very low): Slow convergence, very stable

For transfer learning on Places365, lower learning rates are preferred to 
preserve learned ImageNet features while adapting to scene classification.

#### Batch Size Selection
- **16** (Small): Better generalization, more gradient noise
- **32** (Medium - Recommended): Good balance between efficiency and stability
- **64** (Large): Faster training but may generalize worse

#### Optimizer Selection
- **Adam**: Adaptive learning rates, good for transfer learning
- **SGD**: More stable convergence in some cases, requires careful tuning

## 6. HYPERPARAMETER TUNING JUSTIFICATION

### 6.1 Why These Hyperparameters Matter

**Learning Rate (LR)** - Most Critical
- Controls step size in gradient descent
- Too high: Training divergence
- Too low: Slow convergence, stuck in local minima
- For transfer learning: Start conservative (0.0001)
- Reason: Pretrained weights already good, fine-tune gently

**Batch Size (BS)**
- Trade-off between gradient noise and computational efficiency
- Larger batch: More stable gradients, faster training
- Smaller batch: Noisier gradients (regularization), slower training
- Sweet spot: 16-32 for scene classification

**Optimizer Choice**
- **Adam**: Adaptive learning rates, works well for transfer learning
- **SGD**: More stable in some cases, requires careful tuning

### 6.2 Grid Search Results Interpretation

The grid search evaluates all 24 combinations, showing:
- Which learning rates work best for scene classification
- Impact of batch size on convergence
- Optimizer performance comparison
- Optimal configuration recommendation

### 6.3 Selected Best Configuration Justification

├── Learning Rate: 0.0001
│   └── Reason: Conservative fine-tuning for transfer learning
├── Batch Size: 32

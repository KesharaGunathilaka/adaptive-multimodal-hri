"""
Central configuration for the scene-classification sub-model of the context
modality.

All paths are absolute (derived from this file's location) so every script
works regardless of the current working directory.

Dataset:  Places365 subset, ImageFolder layout under ../data/scene/.
Classes:  the two environments we deploy in — classroom, kitchen.
Target:   lightweight CNN for Jetson Orin Nano scene understanding.

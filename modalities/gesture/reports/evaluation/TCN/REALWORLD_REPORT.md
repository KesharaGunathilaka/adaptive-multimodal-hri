# Gesture real-world evaluation — REGENERATED

- Checkpoint: `best_TCN.pth` (sha256 `7e58aa89645c2796…`, the deployed weights)
- Regenerated: 2026-07-24 on the curated dataset (1007 clips with a defined intended gesture)
- Method: offline whole-clip — pose-valid frames → uniform-resample to 32 → TCN argmax (deployed feature pipeline, reusing per-frame caches).
- **Supersedes the pre-both-hands-up report** (kept as `REALWORLD_REPORT_pre_bhu.md`). Key change: `both_hands_up` is now a trained, recognized class; `point` remains weak.

## Overall: acc = 76.8% · macro-F1 = 77.7% (7 classes present)

## Notes
- `point` scenarios (S03, S22, S29) score low — static pointing is hard to separate from idle in keypoints; a known, still-open gap.
- `both_hands_up` scenarios (S05, S09, S19, S24, S26) are now recognized (the pre_bhu report showed 0% here).
- S08 is a designed [MISSING]-gesture scenario (hands occluded) and is excluded from scoring.

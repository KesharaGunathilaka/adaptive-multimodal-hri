"""The context model's output contract.

`ContextState` is the single structured object the context model emits for the
downstream policy / fusion module. It combines:
  - the environment label from the zero-shot CLIP scene classifier, and
  - the structured situation understanding from a small VLM (SmolVLM2):
    what the person is doing, how many people are present, what the main
    person is focused on, the key objects, and a one-sentence summary.

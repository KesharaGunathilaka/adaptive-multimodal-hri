"""Best-effort structured-field extraction from a free-form VLM caption.

SmolVLM2-500M reliably produces good natural-language scene descriptions but,
like most sub-1B VLMs, does not reliably follow a strict multi-field output
format even with a worked example in the prompt (tested — see
reports in scene_classification/reports/zero_shot for the analogous scene
finding). So the VLM is asked for a plain description (its real strength), and
this module pulls approximate structured fields out of that text with
lightweight regex/keyword rules — no extra model calls, negligible latency,
Jetson-friendly.

These are heuristics, not NLP-grade extraction: `summary` (the raw caption) is
the reliable signal; `people` / `activity` / `attention` / `objects` are a
best-effort approximation for callers that want quick structured access.

Central configuration for the emotion-recognition modality.

All paths are absolute (derived from this file's location) so every script
works regardless of the current working directory.

Dataset:  RAF-DB (7 basic emotions), ImageFolder layout under data/.
Target:   lightweight model for Jetson Orin Nano, optimized for balanced
          (macro-F1) performance on an imbalanced dataset.
